# data-visualizer
I made this repo to build, test and understand a few data visualization techniques. Since, we don't know the final output yet so let's also assume that we'll get two types of data (before and after) in the form of Json. 

## First let's finalize all the basic stuff
### Different Types of Charts and Comparisons:
1. Bar Chart – Compare two or more datasets side by side using rectangular bars.
2. Line Chart – Track trends and changes over time with continuous data points.
3. Scatter Plot – Show relationships and correlations between two numerical variables.
4. Radar Chart – Compare multiple attributes for different categories in a circular layout.
5. Heatmap – Highlight variations in values using different colors for intensity.
6. Box Plot – Display data distribution, quartiles, and outliers in a dataset.
7. Pie Chart – Show proportional representation of different categories in a circular chart.
8. Histogram – Represent the frequency distribution of numerical data in bins.
9. Doughnut Chart – A variation of the pie chart with a hollow center for better visualization.
10. Overlapping Area Chart – Compare multiple datasets by layering colored areas over each other.

The best way to publish the data on the internet would be using Mern stack as it's easily deployable as well.

## Some libraries that we can use:
Chart.js (Simple & lightweight for bar, line, pie charts)
D3.js (Powerful for custom visualizations)
Recharts (React-based, great for dashboards)
Plotly.js (Good for detailed and interactive plots)

This is the only basic part that we'll need to understand at first. After that we'll work on making our data consistent and then after that we'll work on how we should sort and use the data for further usage.
